# Eagle Marsh: Wetland Restoration & Management GIS Framework

## Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive geospatial framework for **Eagle Marsh Nature Preserve** in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It integrates remote sensing, hydrological analysis, field data collection, and operational management workflows to support the restoration and conservation initiatives of the **Little River Wetlands Project**.

The framework combines automated spatial analysis with field-based asset management, creating a scalable solution for monitoring wetland conditions, prioritizing maintenance activities, and communicating conservation efforts to the public.

# Key Workflows

## 1. Automated Hydrological Analysis

Custom **ArcGIS ModelBuilder workflows** automate Sentinel-2 imagery processing to calculate the **Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)**.

The workflow includes:

- Automated geodatabase creation
- Raster clipping and resampling
- Satellite band processing
- Seasonal water extent comparison
- Generation of water gain/loss polygons

Additionally, rainfall simulations (**488 mm precipitation scenario**) were performed using:

- Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
- 3D visualization
- Spatial analysis tools

These simulations helped identify areas where increased water levels could impact critical infrastructure.

## 2. Smart Field Operations

A field-to-office GIS ecosystem was developed to improve asset monitoring and maintenance workflows.

### Asset Inventory

Field personnel collect georeferenced information using **ArcGIS Field Maps**, including:

- Asset location
- Attribute information
- Photographic documentation

### Maintenance Tracking

A **one-to-many (1:M) relationship class** connects conservation assets with maintenance records, creating a historical database of inspections, repairs, and field observations.

### Workforce Coordination

**ArcGIS Workforce** enables real-time assignment and tracking of maintenance activities between dispatchers and field teams.

---

## 3. Decision Support & Public Outreach

### Management Dashboard

An operational dashboard provides a centralized view of:

- Task status
- Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Field activity metrics
- Resource allocation needs

### Educational Story Map

An interactive **ArcGIS StoryMap** communicates Eagle Marsh's ecological transformation, highlighting its recovery from 19th-century agricultural land back into a restored wetland ecosystem.

# Results & Impact

The framework identified potential flood risks affecting sensitive conservation assets, including:

- Bird nesting areas
- Trail sections (2, 6, 7, 8, and 9)

By standardizing field data collection and automating spatial analysis workflows, this project:

✅ Reduces manual processing errors  
✅ Improves conservation decision-making  
✅ Creates a repeatable GIS framework for wetland management  
✅ Supports data-driven restoration strategies for conservation properties
